Continuous Integration - test code as it's updated

Continuous Development - automate the deployment process

Basic Flow
1. Code is stored in a Repository and updated
2. Commits to important branches trigger the following process
	1. Build from source code
	2. Test source code
	3. Save artifacts
3. When deploying reference an environment and version to automate

Technologies
- [[Git]] as a repository
- [[Docker]] for simplifying the build, test, and deploy processes
