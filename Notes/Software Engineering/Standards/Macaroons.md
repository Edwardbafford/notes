Macaroons are a type of token that used to represent a security capability while having the ability for anyone to append caveats to the capability.

Macaroons take advantage of the [[HMAC]] authentication technique to append new caveats.

To add a new caveat feed the old tag and the new caveat into the macaroon to create a new tag which will be used, as shown below.
