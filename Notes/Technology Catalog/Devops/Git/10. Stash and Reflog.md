# Stash

## Push

Method for capturing current state of the work and returning to it when needed

Capture current state of index and working directory

`git stash push` saves working directory and clears it so that it matches the HEAD commit 

New reference is created to map to this data

`--staged` will also save and clear the index

Multiple stashes can be stored at once

`-m` to add a message

`--include-untracked` to stash new untracked files

`--all` to stash untracked and ignored files

## Pop

`git stash pop` restores the most recently stashed system by merging it with the current state

Working directory must match index to pop

Stashed state is removed from stack unless there is a merge conflict and it will have to be manually dropped with `git stash drop`

`git stash apply` to apply the stashed state without dropping

`git stash branch` creates a new branch from the parent commit of the stash and returns the context to this new branch

## Other

`git stash list` to view the list of saved contexts from most recent to least recent

`git stash show <STASH>` to view the diff between the context and the parent commit. Same options are available for this as for [[7. Diff|diff]]


# Reflog

Track reference changes

All reference changes are logged to reflog

Enabled by default -> `core.logAllRefUpdates`

`git reflog show <REF>` to view all reference changes from most recent to least recent

`<REF>` default is `HEAD`

Each line is a transaction that changes the reference

`<COMMIT_ID> <REF>@{<ID>}: <TRANSACTION_DESCRIPTION>`

Each transaction as has a timestamp

Reflog names in the form of `<REF>@{<ID>}` can be used as symbolic names to reference commits

This allows for referencing commits that otherwise can't be referenced

The `<ID>` can be a number but also use other qualifier such as day or time to reference a commit corresponding to that reference and qualifier

Reflog entries eventually expire with different times
- Unreachable commits
	- 30 days by default
	- Control with `gc.reflogExpireUnreachable`
- Reachable commits
	- 90 days by default
	- Control with `gc.reflogExpire`

`git reflog delete` to remove individual entries

`git reflog expire` to expire reflog entries based on a time
