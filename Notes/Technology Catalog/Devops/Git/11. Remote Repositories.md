# Concepts

**Development Repository** is used for every day development. Contains git objects and working directory.

**Bare Repository** is not actively developed on and used as an intersection between multiple development repositories. Only contains git objects.

Use `--bare` option to create a bare repository.

## Remotes

Remote repositories are configured within a repository.

Remote repositories allow the repository to communicate with another one.

`git remote` can be used for CRUD operations on your remote repositories.

Operations
- `git fetch` - retrieve git objects from remote repository
- `git pull` - retrieve git objects from remote repository and merge them into your repository
- `git push` - transfer git object to the remote repository

Branch types
- Remote branches are located in a remote repository
- Remote-tracking branches are associated with a remote branch
- Local-tracking branches are paired with a remote-tracking branch and where active development is made
- Local-nontracking branches or topic branches are not paired with a remote-tracking branch

Namespaces are used to separate the remote and local tracking branches -> `branch_1` vs `origin/branch_1`

Remote repository configurations consist of two components
- URL
- Refspec

URLs are used to locate and communicate with the remote repository
- Filepath
- Git protocol
- SSH
- HTTP/S

### Refspec

Refspecs map branch names from the remote repository to the local repository for various commands.

Format: `<COMMAND> = <SOURCE_BRANCH_PREFIX>:<DESTINATION_BRANCH_PREFIX>`

The source and destination change depending on the operation but are either the local or remote repository.

## Cloning

`git clone <URL>` creates a new repository based on the repository specified by the URL.

All accessible git objects are copied while repository specific details are not.

Cloning automatically creates a remote repository within the new repository linking the cloned and new repository.

The name of the remote repository is by default `origin` but can be set using `--origin <NAME>`

During cloning a remote-tracking branch is created for each topic branch in the remote repository and linked with a local-tracking branch.
