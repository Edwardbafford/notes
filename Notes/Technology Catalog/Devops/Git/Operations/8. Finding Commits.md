## Bisect

`git bisect` is used for isolating a particular commit based an arbitrary criteria.

Uses a binary search.

The idea is to find the first "bad" commit.

`git bisect start <BAD_COMMIT> <GOOD_COMMIT>`

Initiates the process by defining the bounds with a bad commit and a good commit where the bad commit is before the good commit.

Once the process starts git will check out a commit then you define respond to whether or not the commit is good

`git bisect bad` or `git bisect good`

With each response git will checkout another commit, as it executes the binary search.

`git bisect log` to see the history of the binary search.

If you get lost or confused start over with `git bisect replay`

`git bisect visualize --pretty=oneline` to view the commits still in range of consideration

Git will tell you when the first bad commit has been found!

Automate with `git bisect run <COMMAND>` where the command decides a good or bad commit by the return code of the command
- 0 for good
- 1-127 for bad

`git bisect reset` to exit


## Blame

Determine who last modified each line of a file

`git blame -L <START_LINE_NO.>,<END_LINE_NO.> <FILE>`

Use `--since=...` to limit the time range


## Pickaxe

Use `-S<STRING>` option in git log to search back through the history of the file diffs for the given string.

Returns commits that perform a change in the string with either additions or deletions.

`git log -S<STRING> <FILE>`
