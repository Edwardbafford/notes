Entire repository is contained within `.git` directory

Contains two primary structures:
- Object store
- Index

## Object Store

Contains all versions of a project

Four main objects:
- Blobs - opaque binary object
- Trees - directory representation with pointers to blobs and other trees
- Commits - represents a saved version and contains metadata, points to a tree, and a previous commit
- Tags - assign a text name to a commit

Object are compressed and stored in packfiles.

Packfiles find groups of similar files, store the content of one of them then the diffs needed to get from one file to another.

Each object is associated with a unique id by applying a SHA1 hash to the object.

This means objects that are the same will get the same id even if they're in different repositories!


## Index

Stores temporary binary data related to your files.

Used for staging.
