Hooks execute scripts based on Git events.

Hooks are not copied during a clone operation.

Defined in the `.git/hooks` directory and must be executable.

Platforms like Github and Gitlab use hooks to enable extra functionality.


## Examples

Automatically copied from the Git template directory upon install but disabled by adding `.sample` and not being executable.

Can be enabled and edited if needed.
