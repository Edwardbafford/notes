## Access

Git does not enforce access so it must be enforced at another level.
- git-daemon
- http daemon
- custom server
- hosted services such as Github


## Structure

Repository structure again can only be enforced through either another layer of technology or by social contracts.

Best practices
- centralized authoritative repository
- do not re-write branches that have been published

Roles
- Developer - responsible for committing changes
- Maintainer - responsible for the integration of changes

Changes
- Change the origin repository
- Create a repository made out of multiple diverged repositories
- Cloning a repository for it to be merged back in, called **Forking**
