A compact summary of the difference between two items.

Shows the changes required to convert one version into another.

Git uses the Myers diff algorithm for comparison as default.

Can compare any git tree object
- commit
- index
- working directory

`git diff` shows the difference between the working directory and index

`git diff --cached <COMMIT>` shows the difference between the staged changes and a commit where the default commit is the HEAD

`git diff <COMMIT>` compares the working directory against the given commit

`git diff <COMMIT_1> <COMMIT_2>` compares the difference between the two commits

`git diff ... <PATH/FILE>` to filter comparison on a path or file.

`git diff ... -S <STRING>` filters comparison against a string, often called a pickaxe.

In git diffs are calculated at runtime and are not stored.

## Options

`-M` shows a simplified output that shows renames instead of full deletes and adds

`-w` ignores whitespace changes

`--stat` add statistics about the comparison

`--color` colorized the output for different types of changes

`--name-only` shows only the names of the files that have changed

`--name-status` shows the names of the files that have changed along with statuses
- `M` for modified
- `A` for added
- `C` for copied
- `D` for deleted

`--output=<FILE>` directs the output to a file instead of STDOUT


## Output

Displayed in the following order

- Source of diff comparison - displays the input files being compares
- Git object IDs - displays the git object IDs that are being compared
- Source markers - map edit symbols to each file
- Diff hunk headers - enclosed within @@ characters and represent information in the following format `[-/+]<start-line>,<lines of change>`
- Diff hunks - show edits for mapping one file to another
