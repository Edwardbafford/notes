Create [[7. Diff|diffs]] which can be emailed and applied to other repositories.

Allows you to communicate commits without a direct connection
- Extra security
- Peer review enforcement


## Generate

`git format-patch <COMMIT/S>`

`-n` to specify a number of commits from HEAD

One patch file is generated for each commit difference in order from oldest to most recent.

A single commit defaults to a range between the commit and the head `<COMMIT>..HEAD`

Include initial commit with `--root` option

Git will convert the commit range into a linear sequence.


## Mail

Options:
* Import the patch files into a mail agent
* Send with `git send-mail ...`

`git send-mail` has lots of options for configuration


## Apply

`git am <PATCH_FILES>`

Unexpected file differences cause exceptions.

`-3` will initiate merge logic if there are any issues. The merge will look for a previous version of the file that matches the original file before the diff (using the SHA hash) then create a merge conflict between the diff and the current version from the previous version.

Handle with `--continue`, `--skip`, and `--abort` where continue only works after the issue has been resolved.

After applying patches the author and committer can be different and is saved within the commit.
